# Bi-Directional Search
# Operates by running two BFS simultaneously, one from the starting node and one from the destination node
# Each iteration, we'll take one step forward and one step back
# Once the paths overlap, we know we've hit a short path
#
# Queue for FORWARD --- represents the next nodes to visit in the starting_node's BST
# Queue for BACKWARD -- represents the next nodes to visit in the destination_node's BST
